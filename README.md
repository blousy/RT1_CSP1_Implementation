# RT1_CSP1_Implementation
RT-1 implementation using Google Collab 

<h2>Goals</h2>
1. Different Approaches for best results, adjusting and combining visual and text embeddings for model to give reasoning on different images/videos
2. Fine tuning with Habitat-Matterport 3D and/or other datasets primiarily focused on navigational data for RT-1 model to understand and demonstrate improved reasoning on geotrical, spatial and semantic reasonings.
3. Simulate the model in a simulated environment
