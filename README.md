# RT1_CSP1_Implementation
RT-1 implementation using Google Collab 

<h2>Goals</h2>
1. Different Approaches for best results, adjusting and combining visual and text embeddings for model to give reasoning on different images/videos <br><br>
2. Fine tuning with Habitat-Matterport 3D and/or other datasets primiarily focused on navigational data for RT-1 model to understand and demonstrate improved reasoning and understanding on geometrical, spatial and semantic contexts. <br><br>
3. Simulate the model in a simulated environment for testing purposes
 <br> <br> <br>

 <h2>Expected results </h2>

Fine-tuned robotic transformer to navigate into unseen environments in both simulated and real environments more efficiently and able to reason semantic, geometric and spatial understandings
